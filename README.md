# Group Decisionmaking & Values
Resources for creating group decisionmaking structures & values

## Exercises to bring out values alignment & misalignment

* *Sharing Withholds*: The facilitator asks the group to prepare to share things that they may have been witholding from the group. Use leading statements like "One reason I'm worried this won't work is because..."
* *Fill in the gap*: The facilitator creates a sentence that contains an important gap. Prompt the group to say the whole sentence with the gap filled in with the word of their choosing. You might select something like "In this space, I always want to feel ___"
* *Thinking & Feeling*: When presented with a proposal or concept, or if presented with a question, prompt each member of the group to share one thing they are thinking, and one thing they are feeling.
* *Magnet Statements*: Set up the group spatially (either with an online sticky board like Miro or Mural or spatially across an entire room. Prompt the group about a particular concept or topic, and ask one person to make a statement they believe about the topic. Other participants respond by moving closer or further away from the speaker, based on how much they agree or disagree with the sentiment. Then ask for another statement. 

### Google doc exercises/ adaptations

If you're in a remote group and don't think the participants will be able to participate fully by using a technology like Miro or Mural, but do feel that the participants can all reasonably use google docs, this is a tool we can work with to facilitate decisionmaking and discussion.

* You could set up most of the exercises above as google doc exercises by making headings with each prompt, and asking participants to add to the list. Would recommend having a few participants read out loud. They could read theirs, or read one that they agree with or that they have questions about.
